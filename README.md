# LinkedIn User Engagement
Objective:
To identify strategies to reduce user churn and increase active content engagement, particularly among mid-level professionals who are currently passive users.

Background:
LinkedIn has observed a plateau in user-generated content and time spent per session. The challenge is to revitalize engagement metrics without compromising the platform’s professional tone.

Step 2: Framework for Problem Solving
Use established consulting frameworks for clarity and structure.​

Step 2.1: Framework Used – “Profitability + Product-Market Fit” hybrid

1. Market Analysis

What is the current market trend in professional networking?

How are younger professionals engaging differently (short-form vs. long-form)?

2. Customer Segmentation

Identify three cohorts: Active Posters, Passive Consumers, Dormant Accounts.

Define engagement metrics for each segment.

3. Problem Diagnosis

Quantitative: Decline in unique content per user over 6 months.

Qualitative: User feedback suggests content fatigue and algorithmic bias.

4. Strategic Levers

Product: Simplify post creation and diversify content types (polls, quick-share cards).

Marketing: Launch “10 Days of Insight” – a feature guiding users to post career reflections.

Incentive: Introduce “Creator Recognition” badges to encourage participation.

5. Metrics & Success Indicators

+15% increase in DAU (daily active users)

+20% increase in posts per 1000 users

+10% uplift in user retention (month-over-month)
